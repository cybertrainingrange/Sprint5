In the realm of cybersecurity, a sturdy defense mechanism is anchored by two critical elements: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Threat Intelligence. SIEM technology, with its capacity to analyze security alerts in real-time, emanating from network hardware and applications, is pivotal for proactive security incident management. This technology amasses and scrutinizes log data, identifies aberrant behavior, and furnishes actionable alerts, offering organizations a sweeping outlook of their security situation (Scarfone, K., & Mell, P., 2007).

Complementing SIEM, Threat Intelligence works to dissect the methodologies, motivations, and targets of potential threat actors. It involves the compilation, processing, and analysis of data about potential or active threats, providing organizations with the intelligence needed for informed security decisions. Integrating Threat Intelligence with SIEM reinforces an organization's ability to anticipate, identify, and address cyber threats (Liska, A., 2014).  Together, SIEM and Threat Intelligence form a formidable strategy for cybersecurity defense. The swift evolution of the cybersecurity landscape necessitates practical, hands-on training with such tools, thus underlining the importance of their inclusion in comprehensive cybersecurity training programs.

The proposed lesson module for a cybersecurity training range encapsulates this philosophy. It provides an all-inclusive study of SIEM and Threat Intelligence, interweaving theoretical concepts and practical exercises. Students delve into the different types of Threat Intelligence‚ÄîStrategic, Tactical, Operational, and Technical‚Äîwhile also understanding the role of SIEM within a cybersecurity framework (Liska, A., 2014).  Engaging, hands-on activities involve using AWS services such as GuardDuty, Detective, and Security Hub, along with the open-source tool Wazuh, to gain practical experience in SIEM and Threat Intelligence (Amazon Web Services, 2023; Wazuh, 2023).  To enhance real-world understanding, students are also prompted to analyze notable cybersecurity incidents, including the Target Data Breach and the SolarWinds Attack, thereby understanding the practical application of SIEM and Threat Intelligence in threat detection and response (Perlroth, N., 2020; Krebs, B., 2020). This balanced blend of theoretical understanding and practical application, inherent in the module, is designed to give students a comprehensive grasp of how SIEM integrates with Threat Intelligence, thereby bolstering their security detection capabilities.
