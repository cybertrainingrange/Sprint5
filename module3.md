## Log Management

Log Management is a process that helps capture all data that goes through an information System. In relation to SIEM Log Management is a way to investigate suspicious activity and mitigate risk when it pertains to system breaches. Logs contain valuable information about events , activities and errors that occur within your system. Making logs essential when it comes to security monitoring, Incident response and compliance. As it pertains to cybersecurity, log managing is essential in identifying and investigating security incidents. Log managing offers improve security by reducing its attack surface by using centralized logging. This essentially means that log managing is able offer a holistic view of your network, systems or application this makes it easier for system administrators to troubleshoot issues. When you think of Log managing you can think of these 6 core components of log managing collection, monitoring, analysis, retention, index/searching and reporting. Collection is pretty self explanatory: it's the collection of data that passes through the given operating system the logging is taking place on. Monitoring tracks events and activities all in real time. Analysis is the process of viewing the log collection as a whole to identify security threats or other issues. Retention is the process in which helps decide how long data should be kept within a log file. Index or searching is the ability to sort through logs by simply searching for them. Lastly we have reporting which is a 
way to record your findings and a way to prevent the same incident from occurring again.

## Event Correlation

Event Correlation is the process of analyzing and correlating multiple events or logs from different sources to identify patterns. Event correlation is a powerful force behind making Log Managing much more efficient. This is because nowadays there's such a high volume of      data/logs being generated that it's essentially impossible for us to keep track of all the data/logs. To help sort through this data efficiently data is extracted from centralized host logs and application logs then analyzed to see any recurring patterns which may have a significance. By examining events collectively rather than isolated events can reveal insights that will otherwise go unnoticed. This is a vital process which helps identify security risk and operational issues and helps organizations grab a better idea of their IT infrastructure. All in all Event Correlation allows organizations to respond quickly to potential risk or threats as well as it provides a solid foundation for effective Log Management and SIEM systems.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a vital player to any organization's cyber security system. Equipping your organization with SIEM tools provides you with a real-time scan through the information security systems. The tool also creates an event log with a collection of data from multiple sources, correlates between the events across all security panels, and also provides a customizable automatic security notification system. SIEM systems leverage both event correlation and Log Management to enhance its ability to respond to security risk. To encapsulate if you want to stop today's cybersecurity threats, SIEM is a way to secure your organization network incorporating log management and event correlation is another vital factor in making sure your security is robust and your organization is in a good security posture.
